### ðŸ“…  2025-07-05

**Task**: Migrated my personal website from **Gatsby** to **Next.js**  
**Outcome**: Smooth migration. Faster development cycles. Cleaner architecture.


### ðŸ§  Key Learnings

**Prompting is everything** -> The more context I gave Copilot, the more useful and accurate the suggestions were.

**Break down the work**  -> Small, focused tasks lead to better results with AI tools. Big tasks overwhelm.

**Code to learn, not just plan** -> Iterating in code > over-planning. The clarity comes from doing.

**Real value comes from solving problems** -> Whether for yourself or others â€” helping, sharing, and shipping matter more than chasing perfection.
